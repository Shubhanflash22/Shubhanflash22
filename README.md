I am a Master’s student in **Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC San Diego**, specializing in **Machine Learning and Data Science**. I hold a **B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and MSc. in Mathematics from BITS Pilani**, and have professional experience at **Amazon and Piramal Pharma**, where I contributed to **automation solutions, ML-based forecasting tools, and cloud-integrated data pipelines**, achieving measurable improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and operational resilience.

My research interests lie in leveraging **ML and Deep Learning to enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability** in energy systems. Key areas include **energy storage optimization, grid stability, predictive maintenance, and integration of distributed energy resources**. I have hands-on experience applying ANN, LSTM, and RNN models to optimize **Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries**, reducing power loss and operating costs. I am motivated to work in collaborative research environments to develop **data-driven solutions for smart grids, renewable integration, and energy system optimization**.
